Objectives:
Minimize waste by optimizing inventory levels. Identify the most efficient purchasing strategies based on sales, procurement, and inventory data. Evaluate product sales performance to formulate a sustainable inventory management approach.

1. Data Preprocessing:
Consolidate all CSV files into a unified master dataset. Screen for any missing or erroneous entries. Standardize date formats for consistent time series analysis.

2. Inventory Analysis:
Assess inventory status at the year's start and end using BegInvFINAL12312016.csv and EndInvFINAL12312016.csv. Pinpoint products with the highest and lowest inventory presence.

3. Sales Analysis:
Examine SalesFINAL12312016.csv to identify bestsellers and products with sluggish sales. Analyze sales trends over time, considering variables such as sales quantity, sales price, and date.

4. Purchasing Analysis:
Evaluate procurement activities using PurchasesFINAL12312016.csv and InvoicePurchases12312016.csv. Investigate purchase volumes from different suppliers, procurement costs, and supply chain processes.

5. Optimal Stock Level Calculation:
Determine the optimal stock level for each product by leveraging sales, procurement, and inventory data. Propose stock levels tailored to the sales velocity of products and supply lead times. Conclusion: The insights derived from these analyses will provide recommendations for managing inventory in a more efficient and sustainable manner, aiming to cut costs and prevent overstocking and waste.
